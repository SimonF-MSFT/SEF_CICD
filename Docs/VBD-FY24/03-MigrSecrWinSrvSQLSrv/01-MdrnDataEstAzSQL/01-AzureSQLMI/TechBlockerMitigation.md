### **Technical Blocker Mitigation for Modernizing your Data Estate with Azure SQL**

#### (Duration - 40 Hours) *Duration is an approximate, can be adjusted

[Learning Path and Accreditation](https://aka.ms/DAISP1CS2TBMLP) 

#### **A. Objective**

Seek to unblock migration and modernization.

During this engagement, we will prioritize the workaround to help remediate the blocker and possibly work as one Microsoft with CSS organization to accelerate issues or blocker mitigation.

#### **B. Pre-requisites**

[!INCLUDE [Pre-Delivery Checklist](~/VBD-FY24/CommonContent/PredeliveryChecklist.md)]


[!INCLUDE [Customer Scoping](~/VBD-FY24/CommonContent/ScopingGeneral.md)]


  - How many servers\databases are impacted.
  - Understand the Business impact.
  - Focus on keeping the solution paths open.
  - Propose workaround on issues that need more time investment to be resolved.
  - Who is the technical point of contact from the customer side.
  - In parallel, request to engage Microsoft Support If it is not done already.
  - Next step in Technical Blocker Mitigation is to identify the issue or blocker that is preventing or delaying the successful use of the technology.

  At the end of scoping, set clear expectations on what is in scope and what is out of scope with the customer. Use the table below as a guide:
  
| **In Scope**  |
|---------      |
| Unblock anything that is preventing the customer to do a large-scale migration towards Azure SQL MI|
|Issues to configure Azure SQl MI |
|Troubleshoot technical migration blockers |
|Migration method guidance|

| **Out of Scope**  |
|---------          |
| Blockers that are not related to Azure SQL Migration - Customer doesn‚Äôt have a clear policy strategy in place - Application issues and Application code refactoring|
|If it is a technical blocker within the customer's environment, where we have third-party dependencies|

| **Success Criteria for Go-Live Engagement** üèÖ |
|---------                                        |
|Address any existing blockers on technology adoption or migration and offer workaround / solution|
#### **C. Target Audience**

The target audience for this MCEM stage are:

|Customer Role                              |Required or Optional |
|---------                                  | :---------:         |
|Project sponsor and project manager        |    Required         |
|Application Architects |    Required         |
|Networking Specialist (on-premises and Azure)                      |    Required         |
|Security lead                       |    Optional         |

#### **D. Execution**

Schedule working sessions with the customer's technical point of contact.

1. Coordinate working sessions with the technical point of contact at the customer's organization.
   1. Resolve any obstacles that may hinder the customer's migration to Azure SQL MI.
   2. Address any issues that arise during the migration process from on-premises physical or virtual SQL servers to Azure managed instances
   3. Troubleshoot any problems with mapping dependencies between applications and databases during migration.
   4. Resolve any roadblocks that may prevent the use of migration tools or methods.
   5. Address any performance issues related to backup or restoration methods during migration.
   6. Resolve any issues by following the best practices outlined in Azure SQL MI migration guides.
   7. Unblock any issues that prevent Azure SQL MI migration and cause performance slowness in the database.
   8. Address issues related to business continuity setup or failover processes.
   9. Remove any barriers during proof-of-concept (PoC) setup or validation of Azure SQL MI migration.
   10. Collaborate with the customer to define the resolution or workaround that requires additional training or upskilling.
2. Root cause analysis: Once the technical issue has been identified, the next step is to conduct a thorough analysis to determine the root cause.
3. Mitigation plan development: Based on the findings from the root cause analysis, a comprehensive mitigation plan is developed to address the technical issue.
4. Implementation and testing: Once the mitigation plan has been developed, it is implemented and tested to verify that the issue has been successfully resolved.
5. Documentation and knowledge transfer: Finally, the Technical Blocker Mitigation process involves documenting the issue, its root cause, and the mitigation plan, and transferring this knowledge to relevant stakeholders for future reference. Collapse
6. Raise a [UAT ticket](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/UnifiedActionTracker/SitePages/UAT-Video-Portal.aspx?ga=1) for any [technical Feedback](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/t/CS_PMO/Ef4V5V7fSp9Lgr3u01UrMaABEilQwO37ykZ9O00IckhuoA?e=izbk88) or product blockers with long running CRIs in production.

#### **E. Closeout üèÅ**

- Identify the Technical Blockers: Before you can close out technical blockers, you need to identify what they are. This may involve reviewing logs, analyzing error messages, and testing different configurations.
- Develop a Plan: For each technical blocker, develop a plan to resolve it. This may involve working with vendors, modifying code, adjusting configurations, or adding additional resources.
- Document the Resolution: Once the technical blocker is resolved, document the resolution so that others can benefit from your experience.
- Communicate the Resolution: Communicate the resolution to the appropriate stakeholders, including users, managers, and technical staff.
