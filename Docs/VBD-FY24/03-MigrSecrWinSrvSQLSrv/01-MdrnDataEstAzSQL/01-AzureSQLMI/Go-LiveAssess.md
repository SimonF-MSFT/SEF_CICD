> Go-Live Assessment for Azure SQL Managed Instance is not available yet! Please use Go-Live Assessment for Azure SQL Database

Go-live assessment includes a set of things to consider in determining if the customer is prepared to go live. It asks questions to ensure that all prerequisites are complete for going live. It is created to provide a holistic view of the environment and considers all 5 pillars of WAF when determining the go-live readiness.

#### **B. Pre-requisites**

[!INCLUDE [Pre-Delivery Checklist](~/VBD-FY24/CommonContent/PredeliveryChecklist.md)]


   Depending on the customer workload the following assessments may be applicable to determine the go-live readiness as well.
  
  [Conduct Data Services Assessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/azure-architecture-review-data/) and record recommendations:
  - Click the [Start Assessment] button - (If you have not login, portal might ask to login hence follow the login instruction)
  - Give a name for your assessment
  - Select "Data Services"
  - Select "Azure SQL Managed Instance(PaaS)"
  - Select all WAF pillars
  - Answer all questions


[!INCLUDE [Customer Scoping](~/VBD-FY24/CommonContent/ScopingGeneral.md)]



  At the end of scoping, set clear expectations on what is in scope and what is out of scope with the customer. Use the table below as a guide:

| **In Scope**  |
|---------      |
| Evaluate your pre-production workload across the five well-architected pillars|

| **Out of Scope**  |
|---------          |
| Remediation during the assessment delivery and customization of dashboard or any thing outside of WAF Pillars|

| **Success Criteria for Go-Live Engagement** üèÖ |
|---------                                        |
|Checklist of go/no-go decision points            |
|Key risks to the workload deployment identified with proposed recommendations to address identified risks |
|Capture key findings and associated recommendations provided in a Go-Live report |
|Provide guidance for implementing critical short-term recommendations            |
|CSAT completed|

#### **D. Execution**

> **Warning**
>
> Go-Live Assessment for Azure SQL Managed Instance is not available yet! Please use Go-Live Assessment for Azure SQL Database

Assess your pre‚Äêproduction Azure SQL Managed Instance workload to create a go‚Äêlive plan and prepare for a successful deployment. Examine the technical and operational decision points to arrive at a Go/No‚ÄêGo decision. Finally, you receive actionable recommendations to help you to reduce the downtime and risks to your solution in production.

- Understand the functional/non‚Äêfunctional use cases for the Azure SQL Managed Instance workload.
- Determine if the workload is ready to go into production according to Well‚ÄêArchitected pillars.
- Identify blockers or blind spots that would put the production workload at risk.
- [Conduct Go-Live Well-Architected Review](https://learn.microsoft.com/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&id=b0f9a229-5f82-4f19-ae61-b7be31131f4e)
  - Click the [Start Assessment] button
  - You can answer or skip the question "What Platform and Compute Services are in use?"
  - On "What Data Services are in use?" question
    - Select the "Azure SQL Database" option
  - You can answer or skip the question "Which networking service are you using?"
  - Answer all questions

#### **E. Closeout üèÅ**

In order for this engagement to be successful:

- Understand the functional/non‚Äêfunctional use cases for the Azure workload.
- Determine if the workload is ready to go into production according to the Well‚ÄêArchitected pillars.
- Identify blockers or blind spots that could put the production workload at risk

#### **F. Additional References üìñ**

This stage in the process provides architecture guidance and best practices created for architects, developers, and solution owners to improve the quality of their workloads, based on the five aligned and connected [pillars](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/).

- **Cost Optimization:** Managing costs to maximize the value delivered
- **Operational Excellence:** Operations processes that keep a system running in production
- **Performance Efficiency:** The ability of a system to adapt to changes in load
- **Reliability:** The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
- **Security:** Protecting applications and data from threats
- **Key Benefits:** The Azure WAF is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. Provides architectural guidelines as part of customer onboarding and/or assessing customer workloads to provide recommendations to drive cost savings, enhance security, drive efficiency, increase reliability, and incorporate operational excellence into the customer ecosystem
