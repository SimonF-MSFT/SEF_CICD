### **Establish WAF for Modernizing your Data Estate with Azure SQL**

#### (Duration - 40 Hours) *Duration is an approximate, can be adjusted

#### **A. Objective üéØ**

The goal of Azure WAF is to provide our customers set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve their environment, enhance business confidence and maximize the value on their investment by making sure that the environment is being used to its full potential. Through the WAF assessment we can deliver prioritized and actionable recommendations to address each risk to improve the customer‚Äôs workload in a Well-Architected state.  The WAF focuses on **5 pillars**:  

- Increasing **Reliability**
- **Cost** Optimization
- Enhancing **security**
- Drive **Performance** Efficiency
- **Operational** Excellence

The engagement consists of **4** stages or steps:

1. Gather
2. Analyze  
3. Advise
4. Implement

 ![Engagement Stages](../../../media/Engagement_Stages.png)

#### **B. Pre-requisites**

Please review the pre-requisites carefully. The purpose of this step  is to ensure expectations are set, prerequisites are met, stakeholders are identified, and outputs are clear. A key element in this phase is to minimize surprises.  After completing these steps all the key stakeholders - Customer, CSAM, you or anyone else should be on the same page in terms of engagement, logistics, operational items and more. The pre-requisites for this stage is broken down into **4** tasks as explained below.

- **Scoping Email - Customer**

  The scoping email is sent by the CSA to the primary customer point(s) of contact, CSAM, CSA, and Microsoft account team as applicable. The customer point of contact should be the representative responsible for coordinating logistics, requirements, and stakeholders. Typically, the scoping email recipients are the stakeholders who will participate in the assessment.

  - Provide a high level agenda for the scoping call
  - Provide technical requirements to run Azure Workbooks
  
  > **Note**
  >
  > The email should be sent as soon as a scoping call is scheduled with customer, CSAM, and delivery resource. Ideally, it is several business days prior to the scoping call to give the customer time to complete the technical pre-requisites.

  > The Well-Architected Assessments are focused on a specific production Azure workload. A 'workload' or 'application' is a resource or collection of resources that provide end-to-end functionality to one or multiple clients (humans or systems). Also, workload can be an end-to-end scenario (a process, a journey, a business operation) and the IT infrastructure supporting it. It can be one or multiple applications, APIs and databases working together to deliver a specific functionality.

    > üí°**Tip**

    > Day 3 is covered under closeout section as the closeout happens on the last day (day 3)

#### **E. Closeout üèÅ**

- **Closeout Meeting**

    The executive closeout meeting is intended to recap the core findings from the assessment focusing on key strengths and optimization opportunities. It is important to include IT decision makers in this meeting so they gain awareness of improvement recommendations and how Microsoft can help, which they can use to make resourcing and investment decisions on what steps will be taken to execute on the recommendations.

- **Day 3** - Morning Session (with Customer)
**Key Activities**
  - Step 1: [Present Executive Report](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/DataAIPremierOfferings/Production/Maintain/Assessment_Program/Well-Architected%20Assessment%20for%20Data%20Platforms/5-Closeout?csf=1&web=1&e=ipmsqP)
  - Step 2: [Share deliverables with customer](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/DataAIPremierOfferings/Production/Maintain/Assessment_Program/Well-Architected%20Assessment%20for%20Data%20Platforms/5-Closeout?csf=1&web=1&e=ipmsqP)
  - Step 3: Handover to CSA and CSAM

**Step 1: Present Executive Report**

Present delivery artifacts to customer and capture any final discussion on findings, recommendations, and improvement plan.

>‚ùó**Important**
>
> Assure customer's agreement and commitment to implement the **top 3 recommendations**.

  Negotiate with customer to commit on implementing the top 3 recommendations. Open and annotate the improvement plan on Azure DevOps or GitHub together with customer; assign task owners and completion dates.

> üí°**Tip**
>
> If the customer needs time to find the owners and determine dates, CSA and CSAM needs should follow up and finalize within 14 days after the closeout.

**Step 2: Share Deliverables with Customer**
At the end of the engagement, provide a set of reporting and dashboard deliverables for the customer to use as references to execute on the improvement recommendations and for internal reporting purposes.

  | **Deliverable Name**  |
  |---------         |
  |1. Well-Architected Assessment for Data Platform - Recommendations and Optimizations Executive Summary.PPTx with top 3-5 recommendations |
  |2. Recommendations CSV export from Microsoft Assessments|
  |3. (Optional) Improvement plan on Azure DevOps or GitHub|

Use Services Hub file sharing to securely share reports with the customer.

- Login to Services Hub and navigate to your profile (top right) -> Workspaces. Select your customer workspace
- Navigate to Resources -> Shared Files and upload files to the customer workspace. Select Other for the type of files
- Ensure/confirm if the customer is able to access and download the shared files

**Step 3: Handover to CSA and CSAM**
To conclude the engagement, handover outstanding items and deliverables to CSAM and CSA. This includes:

- List of unanswered questions and Microsoft action items
- Upload engagement deliverables to Services Hub
- During the closeout meeting, explicitly call-out who the CSAM and CSA are, and ensure the customer has their contact details
- Ensure ownership and continuity from CSAM and CSA

**Upload Deliverables to the ServicesHub**
Upload deliverables to the Shared Files section of Services Hub. This [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/services-hub/unified/contracts/contract-sharedfiles) has step-by-step upload instruction.

If applicable, CSAM can follow instructions on [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/services-hub/unified/contracts/manage-users) to grant access to both, you and CSA.
