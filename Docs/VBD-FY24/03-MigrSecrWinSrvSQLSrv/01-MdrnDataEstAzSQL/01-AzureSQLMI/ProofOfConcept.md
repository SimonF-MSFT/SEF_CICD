[Learning Path and Accreditation](https://aka.ms/DAISP1CS2PoCLP)

#### **A. Objective**

This guide will provide details and instructions to help you deliver a successful Proof of Concept for your customer. The Proof of Concept must accomplish the following objectives :

- Deploy a functional version of your solution in a small scale to determine its feasibility & reinforce design decisions
- Demonstrate the business and technical value of the solution.

#### **B. Pre-requisites**

[!INCLUDE [Pre-Delivery Checklist](~/VBD-FY24/CommonContent/PredeliveryChecklist.md)]


[!INCLUDE [Customer Scoping](~/VBD-FY24/CommonContent/ScopingGeneral.md)]


  At the end of scoping, set clear expectations on what is in scope and what is out of scope with the customer. Use the table below as a guide:

  | **In Scope** |
  |---------     |
  |Deploy a functional small‚Äêscale version of the solution |
  |Demonstrate small data migration along with best practices (Note - The workload to be migrated should be small enough to allow the synchronization to happen in a day) |
  |Demonstrate the business and technical value of the solution |

  | **Out of Scope**  |
  |---------          |
  |Landing Zone creation or VPN infrastructure setup and ExpressRoute configuration for hybrid connectivity with Azure |
  |Migrate workloads with terabytes of data |

  | **Success Criteria** üèÖ |
  |--------- |
  |Deliver a small prototype of the solution proposed to prove the feasibility of the solution |

#### **C. Target Audience**

  Having the right customer participants in the engagement is essential for success. Ensure the customer roles outlined in the next table are available and able to participate in the workshop.

  |Customer Role | Required or Optional|
  |----          |----                 |
  |Project Sponsor and/or Project Manager | Required|
  |Database Architects                    | Required|
  |Application Architects                 | Optional|
  |Database Administrators                | Required|
  |Infrastructure Architects              | Optional|
  |Security Architects                    | Optional|

#### **D. Execution**

Deliver a functional small‚Äêscale version of the solution that can be used to determine its feasibility and reinforce design decisions within the agreed scope. Demonstrate the business and technical value of the solution.

- Accelerate and deploy a [Proof-of-Concept](https://aka.ms/SQLMigrationPoC) environment of SQL Server migration to Azure SQL Managed Instance with encapsulated best practices and step-by-step execution steps that will enable you to test, adjust and fully deploy the automated solution at scale.
- [Automate migration from SQL On-Prem to SQL Managed Instance](https://dev.azure.com/CEandS/Azure-Data-Migrations/_wiki/wikis/Automate-SQL-MI-Migration/871/Introduction) to help customers who are running SQL Server 2016 and below where they can‚Äôt opt for zero downtime migration using AlwaysOn Distributed Availability group replica.
  
POC success leads to presenting the results to stakeholders, while failure offers two choices:

- Retrying the POC by redefining goals, scope, or architecture;
- conducting a post-mortem to learn from the experience.

In order to assist the customer with this scenario, below are various **deliveries, documents, and other assets** that you can leverage. Please note you are not limited to or bound by the below deliveries.  You have the freedom to use the below deliveries, come up with your own custom deliveries, mix and match, etc. to reach a solution that is favorable to the customer.
