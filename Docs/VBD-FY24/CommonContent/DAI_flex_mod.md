### VBD Effort and Duration
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All VBDs are considered FIXED PRICE engagements with a price calculated based on ESTIMATED EFFORT. Please keep in mind that the cost for any additional time spent will be absorbed by Microsoft and will not be billed to the customer.

> If more time is scoped than available as one delivery options, mix and match to get to the best duration using 1, 2 or eventually more requests and dispatches.

#### Flexibility and Modularity
 
 **Flexible Delivery:** is supported across multiple scenarios.
  - Some titles offer Short Durations like 1-day vs Full SKU like 3-day.
  - Scheduling **Non-Contiguous Deliveries** is supported.
  - CSA's have the flexibility to adjust the delivery based on the customers needs as agreed  in the customer scoping call.

**Modularity:** Services with modular content have a breadth of content options that can be delivered. Often this is seen in Upskilling titles.
