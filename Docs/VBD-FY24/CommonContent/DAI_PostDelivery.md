### **Step 6: Post Delivery**

With the delivery complete there are opportunities to follow up with customer through new VBDs.

Some deliveries will not raise new opportunities. In most deliveries the CSA will have discussions with customer about potential and recommended next steps to continue the clients journey.

Be sure to update the Customer Success Plan with the new opportunities and next steps, and communicate with the CSAM.
