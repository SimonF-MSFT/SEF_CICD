**Key Objectives**

- Ensure scope, objectives, format, prerequisites, and deliverables are understood by the customer.
- Confirm engagement specifics.
- Confirm dates, logistics and attendees

**After the meeting**:  Complete the scoping phase 
- Following your scoping discussion, complete the "Kick-Off" template on the IPKit. This contains a template for the agenda of the engagement. Once this has been filled in, you can e-mail the customer to confirm the agenda. 
- Consider sharing a screenshot of the finished agenda slide for them to confirm. If modifying any standard agenda items, be sure to call out the change so that it's easy for the customer to see and sign off.
- Send an email summary of the activity scope and schedule agreed upon, requesting approval in writing for this work to proceed.

>**Make sure the delivery is a good fit**
>
> While speaking to the customer, you might discover that the team that you will be working with has skilling requirements that differ from the delivery or delivery SKU(s) booked. The customer's CSAM can help you re-scope this delivery if necessary. It is their responsibility to position and resource deliveries as necessary. Try to raise a request for a change like this as early on in the process as possible.

**Technical Requirements and Pre-Requisites**
<!---  Requriments will change depending on the lab type.  we should make several options depending on the lab delivery --->

In order to run most labs successfully, the customer needs to - at a minimum - ensure that:
- All participants have access to an Azure Subscription.
- All participants have Owner permissions on at least the Azure resource groups that the need to work with as part of the lab.
- There is sufficient Azure credit/budget (50 USD or more recommended) per participant available to allow for experimentation and to spin up some more expensive data service.
