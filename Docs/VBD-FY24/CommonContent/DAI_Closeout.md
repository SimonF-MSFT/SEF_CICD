### **Step 5: Customer Closeout Meeting**

In the customer closeout meeting, provide the customer a summary of the engagement, including progress, achievements, and issues for further follow-up engagements.  It is also important to recommend next best action, which may include additional VBD titles. You may use existing materials and templates available in the IP Kit.
