### Step 1: Preparing for the delivery

**Pre Scoping**

Connect with the account team around the needs for this delivery.
During the Prepare phase of the engagement it is important to have good context of the customer business/technical requirements and ensure Microsoft internal team alignment.

> We recommend the pre-scope call is scheduled as soon as the dispatch is assigned to the CSA.
> Pre-scoping and scoping guidance are outlined of the VBD Execution Playbook.

Playbook Guidance: [FY25-VBD-Execution-Playbook- Slide 67](http://aka.ms/vbd)

Other Considerations:
- Make sure CSAM is included and kept up-to-date on all communications with the customer.
- Make sure that you have ROSS dispatch for the engagement. CSAM can assist with that and is responsible for ROSS dispatch.
- There should be a corresponding MSX number.
- Clarify who would be sending the meeting invites - CSAM, TSP, CSA, customer or someone else, once the engagement has been confirmed after the scoping call with the customer.
- Try to understand the nuance related to the account that you are working on - any political, sales, account renewals or other considerations. CSAM can update you on that.
