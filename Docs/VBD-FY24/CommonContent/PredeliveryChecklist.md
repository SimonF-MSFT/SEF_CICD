- **Pre-delivery Checklist - Internal ✅** 

1. As a starting point, it is recommended to have an internal scoping call with the CSAM or any other relevant stakeholders to gather as much information as possible prior to scoping call with the customer (In some cases CSAM or other Microsoft person might not have all the information the CSA is looking for).
1. Make sure CSAM is included and kept up-to-date on all communications with the customer.
1. Make sure that you have ROSS dispatch for the engagement. CSAM can assist with that and is responsible for ROSS dispatch.
1. There should be a corresponding MSX number.
1. Clarify who would be sending the meeting invites - CSAM, TSP, CSA, customer or someone else, once the engagement has been confirmed after the scoping call with the customer.
1. Try to understand the nuance related to the account that you are working on - any political, sales, account renewals or other considerations. CSAM can update you on that.
