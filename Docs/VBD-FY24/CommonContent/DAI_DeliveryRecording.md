> 4. There are certain countries (Ex. Canada) that have more stringent privacy concerns especially around storage/recording or scenarios where the business wants to limit access to the recording. For these instances, an amendment may be needed. An Empowerment has been developed to simplify scenarios with specific privacy concerns, which can be accessed here.
